I worked with Wedyan and Yun to learn how to use the Form Labs printers that we have in the lab and in CBA. Using the I made some new 3D prints of a mechanical robot arm and some sample prints of miniatures from the Tangible Media group lab. My next idea is to use the Stratsys printer to prototype miniatures from the tangible media lab that can actuate. I hope to make a miniature version of Transform and InTouch as part of my final project. The draft version is seen below: <img src="tn/images/transform.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/> <img src="tn/images/intouch.JPG" alt="drawing" width="200"/> <img src="tn/images/print4" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

    I talked with Ozgun and she suggested we use a rack and pin rotation mechanism inside the print so that we could indiviually move the top pins along some general motion. This seems like an accessible way to make a toy transform that would demonstrate its appeal and fundamental function.
