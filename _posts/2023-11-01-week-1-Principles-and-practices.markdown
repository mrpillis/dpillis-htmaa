On October 19th, for week 1 of the independent study, I met with Dr. Gershenfeld to discuss plans for using the 3D scanners in the E14 workspace of the Center for Bits and Atoms.

  We proposed that I would make holokit prototypes as part of the initial research project into imaging technology. I started by learning how to use the Bambuu 3D printer. Bambuu is state of the art 3D printer that John set me up with in the HTMAA space. I focused my first few weeks on learning now to use the Artec Leo for high quality color 3D scanning. I plan collaborate with shop staff to use the Stratasys J850 to 3D print objects that will be duplicates, inversions, miniatures and variations of the scanned objects.
