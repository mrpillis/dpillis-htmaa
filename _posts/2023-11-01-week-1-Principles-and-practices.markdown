On October 19th, during the first week of the independent study, I met with Dr. Gershenfeld to discuss plans for using the 3D scanners in the E14 workspace at the Center for Bits and Atoms.

  We proposed that I would develop HoloKit prototypes as part of an initial research project into imaging technologies. I began by learning how to use the Bambu Lab 3D printer—a state-of-the-art system that John set me up with in the HTMAA space. My first few weeks were focused on learning to use the Artec Leo for high-quality, full-color 3D scanning. I also plan to collaborate with the shop staff to use the Stratasys J850 to 3D print objects that are duplicates, inversions, miniatures, and variations of the scanned artifacts.
