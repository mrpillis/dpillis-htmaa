On October 25th I met with Quentin and we looked at workflows for planning how to make a 3D scanner. We thought of this as a portable lightstage or portable panoptic studio for small objects. 20-30 Rasperry Pi Cameras. Initial plans: Rasperry Pi Zero with Camera Cable-3D Printed Geodesc Dome of Cameras-Expandable Bucky Ball- Compute with SIFT for each image. Stream the data super fast.Goal- Instant 3D object scanning- Top and bottom. Explore contemporary formats like ThreeJS and MeshGPT. I experimented with Polycam’s floorplan tool and it is disappointing. It renders objects as if they are in a domestic setting automatically. It didn’t work for me when I tried to scan an unconventional space. I used grabCad to find models of seeed studio xiao nrf52840 3d model.
