On October 24th, I met with John to review 3D scanning and 3D printing workflows.

We compared three key approaches to 3D reconstruction:

- **Photogrammetry**
- **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)**
- **3D Gaussian Splatting**

  <p>
  We discussed the tradeoffs between traditional photogrammetry, which relies on many still images and reconstruction via point clouds, and newer machine-learning-based methods like NeRFs and Gaussian splats, which are better at handling view-dependent lighting and fine surface detail. While photogrammetry is reliable and well-supported in existing pipelines, NeRFs and Gaussian splats offer faster capture-to-render workflows and are more suitable for immersive and interactive applications.
